A quick SVN reference:

remote checkout:
	# cd /home/user/projects
	# svn checkout svn+ssh://dev.wifibsd.org/svn/wifibsd wifibsd 

remote checkout, specifying the user:
	otheruser> cd /home/otheruser/working
	otheruser> svn checkout svn+ssh://user@dev.wifibsd.org/svn/wifibsd wifibsd

remote checkout, web:
	# svn checkout http://dev.wifibsd.org/svn/wifibsd wifibsd

local checkout:
	svn checkout file:///home/svn/wifibsd wifibsd

creating a new repository:
	# svnadmin create /home/svn/repository
	# chown -R :src /home/svn/repository
	# chmod -R g+wrs /home/svn/repository 

moving a repository:
lets say you want to move a repostory from one server to another:

on first server:
	# svnadmin dump /home/svn/repository > repository.dump

on second server:
	# mkdir /home/svn/riseup
	# svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /home/svn/riseup/<repository>
	# svnadmin load /home/svn/riseup/repository < repository.dump 
	# chown -R root:src /home/svn/riseup
	# chmod -R g+rws /home/svn/riseup

finally, each person who has the repository checked out:
	# cd <repository>
	# svn switch --relocate <url-from> <url-to> 

for example: 
	# svn switch --relocate svn+ssh://dev.wifibsd.org/svn/wifibsd svn+ssh://masta.yazzy.net/var/lib/svn/riseup/wifibsd

Fixing corrupt repository databases
On the repository server:
	# svnadmin recover /home/svn/<repository>
	# chmod -R g+ws /home/svn/<repository>
	# chown -R :staff /home/svn/<repository> 

The group might be different depending on the access that should be given to the repository.

converting a repository from BDB to FSFS
Lets say you keep getting database corruption errors and are sick of it. Lets say you read svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/notes/fsfs and decided that FSFS was a better backend 
storage mechanism than BDB so you wanted to switch to it. This is how you do it:

	# svnadmin dump /home/svn/<repository> > /tmp/<repository>.dump
	# rm -rf /home/svn/<repository>
	# svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /home/svn/<repository>
	# svnadmin load /home/svn/<repository> < /tmp/<repository>.dump
	# chown -R :staff /home/svn/<repository>
	# chmod -R g+ws /home/svn/<repository> 


using the repository:

          - edit a file in your working copy.
          - run 'svn diff' (svn di) to see the changes.
          - run 'svn commit' (svn ci) to commit the changes.
          - run 'svn up' to bring your working copy up-to-date.

	  - run svn help for more commands

The branches dir has current, stable and release dirs, the current work dir is in current.



Scheme for its branches and tags:
 
/branches: contains all official branches, where people still develop stuff. 
Generally, those branches happen after a release, so that backporting of bugfixes from /trunk doesn't bring untested code. 
/tags: contains all official tags. That is, when you make a public release and you want to mark the 
revision in which it happened, you create a tag here. 
/work: contains working, temporary branches. This is where unstable features are developed before they are merged into /trunk. 

In /branches and /tags, the naming convention used is like this:
 
/branches/operatingsystemname/branchversion (example: /branches/freebsd/1.4) 
/tags/operatingsystemname/releaseversion (example: /tags/freebsd/1.3.2)
