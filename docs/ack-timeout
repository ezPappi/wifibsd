The Atheros card has been tested for distances up to 20 km providing connection speed up to 17Mbit/s. 
With appropriate antennas and cabling the maximum distance should be as far as 50 km.                                     

These values of ack-timeout were approximated from the tests done by us, as well as by some of our customers:
range   ack-timeout
5GHz    5GHz-turbo      2.4GHz-G
0km     default         default         default
5km     52      30      62
10km    85      48      96 
15km    121     67      133
20km    160     89      174
25km    203     111     219
30km    249     137     368
35km    298     168     320
40km    350     190     375
45km    405     -       -

Please note that these are not the precise values. Depending on hardware used and many other factors they may vary up to +/- 15 microseconds.
