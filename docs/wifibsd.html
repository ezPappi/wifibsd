<h3><li>Introduction.</h3>

This HowTo describes the way of installing wifiBSD which supports the latest Atheros chips.
At the point of writing this HowTo support for atheros cards is avaliable in FreeBSD 5.1-CURRENT > only.
<br>Firstly we need to cvsup to get the latest sources and drivers of FreeBSD.
<br>We will need to create a virtual environment - jail.
<br>The purpose of it is we can have one main FreeBSD system running -RELEASE or STABLE version and one jailed/virtual  
version of Freebsd inside our actual system with the newest sources.  
<br>We'll also be overwriting some binaries of the base system with our custom, tuned binaries and it's much saver to do that in a "sandbox".

<h3><li>Preparing your soekris board.</h3>

Firstly we need to set up the soekris board.
<br>Install minicom , start it up and press CTRL A and then O (still keeping the CTRL button pressed).
<br>Scroll down to Serial port setup and then set the Bps/Par/Bits to 19200 8N1 (Press E) and set Hardware Flow Control to No (Press F).
<br>Soekris boards use 19200 Bits as default. 
<br>Now we need to change that value to 9600. 
<br>When your 45xx starts to boot, press Ctl-P to stop the boot process and get to the BIOS command prompt.  
<br>Now type set ConSpeed=9600.
<br>Set up the rest accoridingly:
Recommended BIOS settings for the net45xx
<pre>
ConSpeed = 9600
ConLock = Enabled
BIOSentry = Disabled
PCIROMS = Disabled
PXEBoot = Disabled
FLASH = Primary
BootDelay = 2
BootPartition = Disabled
ShowPCI = Enabled
</pre>
You may also set correct date, i.e date 2003/08/14
<br>
<h3><li>Installing jailed environment.</h3>

<br>Firstly we need to build a new jail for our wifiBSD.
<br>Get down fresh FreeBSD sources with cvsup and run this script. 
<br>Adjust it if needed:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# jailsetup.sh version 0.1
# Jail setup script for wifiBSD based on FreeBSD 5.1 > by yazzy@ezunix.org

email="yazzy@ezunix.org"        # Whom to notice.
wifibsd="$D/usr/wifibsd"        # Installation dir of wifiBSD

if [ x"$1" = x ]
then
   echo Usage: jailsetup.sh [dir]
   echo example: jailsetup.sh /usr/jail
   exit
fi

echo
echo It is your last chance to abort the process.
echo Press Enter to proceed or CTRL + C to abort
read ANYKEY

D=$1

if [ -f $D ]
then
   echo Error. A file has the same name as the destination directory.
   echo Please remove $D first.
   exit
fi

if [ ! -d $D ]; then
   echo The directory $D did not exist. We will create it now.
   /bin/mkdir -p $D
   sleep 3
   echo $D Created. Proceeding...

else
   echo Checking if the $D directory exists. It will be created if not.
   echo Looks ok. Proceeding...
fi

# Do the code crunching
cd /usr/src
make world DESTDIR=$D
cd etc
make distribution DESTDIR=$D
mount_devfs devfs $D/dev
cd $D
ln -sf dev/null kernel

#Create some system files
touch $D/etc/fstab
cp /etc/resolv.conf $D/etc/resolv.conf                                      
cp /etc/localtime  $D/etc/localtime

#       Let us create directory tree for the whole wifiBSD
if [ ! -d ${wifibsd} ]; then mkdir -p ${wifibsd} ;
        mkdir $wifibsd/bin $wifibsd/dev $wifibsd/mnt $wifibsd/modules $wifibsd/proc $wifibsd/root $wifibsd/sbin $wifibsd/var
        mkdir -p $wifibsd/boot/defaults
        mkdir -p $wifibsd/etc/defaults $wifibsd/etc/mtree $wifibsd/etc/namedb $wifibsd/etc/ppp $wifibsd/etc/ssh $wifibsd/etc/ssl
        mkdir -p $wifibsd/usr/bin $wifibsd/usr/lib/aout $wifibsd/usr/libexec $wifibsd/usr/local $wifibsd/usr/share/misc
	ln -s /var/tmp/ $wifibsd/tmp
fi

echo
echo "Build of wifiBSD finished at `date +%d%m%Y` !" | mail -s "jail build of wifiBSD complete: `date +%d%m%Y`" $email
</pre>

When you're done, run:

<pre>
# chroot /usr/jail
</pre>

Modify the "set prompt" line in /usr/jail/root/.cshrc if you want to be reminded of the fact that you're inside the jail
by the shell prompt:
<pre>
# set prompt = "wifiBSD %~ %# "
</pre>

Still in chrooted env, edit your /etc/rc.conf
<pre>
network_interfaces=""
sendmail_enable="NONE"
inetd_enable="YES"
inetd_flags="-wW -a 10.0.0.1"
rpcbind_enable="NO"
hostname="jail.wifiBSD.org"
cron_enable="NO"
syslogd_enable="NO"
portmap_enable="NO"
sshd_enable="YES"
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> The IP which inetd will bind to is the same IP which is/will be used by your jail setup.
<br>Now edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change #ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 to ListenAddress 10.0.0.1
<br>Change also #PermitRootLogin no to PermitRootLogin yes. This is for us to be able to login to our jail enviroment from our host.
<br>Now you can logout from your jail system and create an IP alias for your nic:
<pre>
# ifconfig fxp0 inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.255  
</pre>
Change your /etc/rc.conf to make the IP alias permanent by adding following line:
<pre>
ifconfig_fxp0_alias0="inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.255"
</pre>
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file being still outside of the jail and bind ssh to your actual IP, the same way as above.
<br>Run killall -HUP sshd.
<br>Create a startup file for our jail in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ and call it i.e jail.sh
<pre>
#! /bin/sh
/sbin/mount_devfs devfs /usr/jail/dev/
/usr/sbin/jail /usr/jail jail 10.0.0.1  /bin/sh /etc/rc
</pre>
Now run chroot /usr/jail again.
<br>Run sh /etc/rc to start and check things. You will also see public/private being generated.
<br>Set root's pass running passwd root.
<br>Log out and run  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/jail.sh
<br>Now you should be able to ssh in to your jail as root. The point in doing this is you cannot su - in jail enviroment. 
<br>One could of course run sudo.
<br>Login to your jail and run cvsup command to get down the source tree of FreeBSD.
<br>
<h3><li>Making the directory tree.</h3>
<br>
We'll put together our whole wifiBSD installation in one directory, 
<br>so in the end we could theoretically just copy everything from that directory over to the flash card. 
<br>I'll leave it up to you where you're going to create this directory; 
<br>mine is /usr/local/wifibsd and the rest of the guide assumes that yours is, too (just make sure you got about 100 MB of space left on the partition where you
create it). 
<br>That done, we need to populate this directory with some standard subdirectories (bin, dev, etc, usr, and so on). 
<br>You could use mtree to populate it with empty directories, but I prefer to do it manually. 
<br>Here is the tree of directories you have to mkdir:
<pre>
.
|-- bin
|-- boot
|   `-- defaults
|-- dev
|-- etc
|   |-- defaults
|   |-- mtree
|   |-- namedb
|   |-- ppp
|   |-- ssh
|   `-- ssl
|-- mnt
|-- modules
|-- proc
|-- root
|-- sbin
|-- tmp -> /var/tmp
|-- usr
|   |-- bin
|   |-- lib
|       `-- aout
|   |-- libexec
|   |-- local
|   |-- sbin
|   `-- share
|       `-- misc
`-- var
</pre>

Permissions are 0755 (root.wheel) for all directories except /proc (0555). You may also want to chmod 0700 /root, but that is a matter of personal
taste. :)
Don't forget the link from /tmp to /var/tmp - it's important as the root file system will later be mounted read-only (we'll provide a memory file
system for /var).
<br>
<h3><li>Rebuilding the boot loader.</h3>
The net4501 BIOS seems to have a little bug in its serial console emulation - if you boot a standard FreeBSD bootloader on it, it will spread the
characters (e.g. the "swoosh" (- \ | / - ...) all over your terminal. When the kernel boots, things are normal again, but it may be important to see
the error messages in case the bootloader cannot boot the kernel. To fix this, we have to recompile the boot loader (don't worry, it's easy and quick).
<br>
<b>Note:</b> you'll need to have the developer distribution installed on your base system to recompile the boot loader - just the kernel sources is not
sufficient. You can install the developer distribution with /stand/sysinstall. If you can't/don't want to recompile the boot loader, you can download a
precompiled boot loader (for 5.1-CURRENT) <a href="index.php">here</a>. gunzip it and throw it in /boot/loader. Don't forget to chmod 555 it.
<br>
Edit <b>/sys/boot/i386/libi386/Makefile</b> and comment out the line that reads:
<pre>
CFLAGS+= -DTERM_EMU
</pre>
Leave the editor, and run:
<pre>
# cd /sys/boot 
# make clean && make && make install 
</pre>
Of course this will also change the boot loader of your base FreeBSD system to not use terminal emulation, but that doesn't hurt much.
<br><br><b>Importand!</b> Set CPUTYPE=i486 in your /etc/make.conf for soekris boards!</b> Otherwise your loader will compile for pentium architecture and soekris will never boot.
<br>

<h3><li>Dynamic vs. static executables</h3>
<br>
In a normal FreeBSD installation, the binaries in /bin and /sbin are linked statically, which means they do not depend on any libraries in order to work. 
<br>This makes them much bigger, though, and you can save several MBs (about 6.7 MB with my binary set) by linking them dynamically, too. 
<br>Since we keep everything on one partition, they would still be usable in single-user mode because the libraries are available. 
<br>The only disadvantage is that if your libraries get
corrupted, you won't be able to do much on the system to fix it. 
<br>Decide for yourself whether you want them to be dynamically linked. If you do, edit /etc/make.conf and add the line
<pre>
NOSHARED=no
</pre>
to it. Then cd to /usr/src/bin and type make clean && make && make install. Do the same for /usr/src/sbin. Voila`.

NOTE: if you actually run "make install" with NOSHARED=no set on a real FreeBSD system (not in a jail as explained in chapter 1.1), you should really make
sure that your /usr directory is in your root partition (not in a separate partition). Otherwise your next reboot will fail horribly because /sbin/init is
linked dynamically but the required libraries can't be found (since the other partitions are not mounted at that time, yet).

If you feel like saving another 400 KB (with my binary set), you can do the same for /usr/src/usr.bin, because a few binaries in there (bzip2, gzip and tar
among others) are also linked statically by default.
<br>

<h3><li>Copying the binaries over.</h3>
</pre>
I made a little shell script that reads a
file which lists all the necessary binaries and copies them over, recreating the proper hard links in the process (for example, /bin/ln and /bin/link are the
same file, but if you copy them over with cp, you end up with two copies of ln/link on your wifiBSD file system, thus wasting a lot of space).
<br>
Get <a href="files/wifibsd.sh">wifibsd.sh</a>, <a href="files/wifibsd.subr">wifibsd.subr</a> and my list of binaries, <a href="files/wifibsd.files">wifibsd.files</a>. 
<br>Now edit the variables if needed and execute wifibsd.sh 
<pre>
# ./wifibsd.sh
</pre>

wifibsd.sh will read the list of files in wifibsd.files and copy them from your system in / into your wifiBSD root file system in /usr/wifibsd. My file list
contains a reasonable amount of binaries tuned to sacrifice the least amount of functionality for my purpose, but still fit well on a CF card. Things like
perl and sendmail are missing, however, because I don't really need them. If you do, change wifibsd.files to reflect your requirements.
<br>
If you feel like saving almost 200 KB, you can copy the stripped-down termcap file from PicoBSD over the standard /usr/wifibsd/usr/share/misc/termcap file.
You'll find the replacement file in /usr/src/release/picobsd/mfs_tree/etc/termcap. The standard termcap file contains many terminal types that you probably
won't use anyway. There's also a stripped services file in /usr/src/release/picobsd/mfs_tree/etc/services. (suggested by Stuart Henderson)
<br>
<h3><li>Making the kernel.</h3>
<pre>
# cd /sys/i386/conf
# config WIFIBSD
# cd /sys/i386/compile/WIFIBSD 
# make depend && make
</pre>
When it's done, you should have your kernel. We will now install it gzipped to save even more space:
<pre>
# gzip -9 kernel
# mkdir -p /usr/wifibsd/boot/kernel
# cp kernel.gz /usr/wifibsd/boot/kernel
</pre>

<h3><li>Copying the libraries</h3>
<br>
We did not copy all the essential libraries in /usr/lib yet. These are not listed in wifibsd.files because the list of required libraries depends on which
binaries you have installed. In an earlier version of this guide, we would just copy all libraries in /usr/lib and then remove those that we were sure would
not be required (e.g. *.a). That still left a lot of unnecessary libraries (about 5.9 MB with FreeBSD 4.6) lying around. If you use my file list
(wifibsd.files), the libraries that are absolutely necessary weigh in at 3.2 MB - so that means another 2.7 MB saved.

<br>
I wrote a script, wifibsd.sh (the same one as above), which walks through your wifiBSD tree and uses ldd on all binaries to extract a list of only those
libraries that are required for at least one binary in your wifiBSD system. Every requiered library was copied over then we run it the first time.
<br>
The only libraries that are still missing now are the PAM modules. Doing a
<pre>
cp -p /usr/lib/pam* /usr/wifibsd/usr/lib
</pre>
should fix that. If you don't want all PAM modules (you probably won't need Kerberos modules, for example), you should copy at least pam_deny, pam_permit,
pam_unix, pam_login_access and pam_nologin.
<br>Finally, if you mkdir /usr/wifibsd/usr/lib/aout, you will avoid the warning message that appears otherwise.
<br>
That's it. Our libraries directory has been populated.
<br>
<h3><li>Populating /etc</h3>
<br>

Edit your /etc/rc.conf
<pre>
hostname="wifibsd.wrs.no"
ifconfig_sis0="192.168.64.7 netmask 255.255.255.0"
kern_securelevel_enable="NO"
nfs_reserved_port_only="YES"
sendmail_enable="NONE"
sshd_enable="YES"
usbd_enable="NO"
inetd_enable="NO"
portmap_enable="NO"
diskless_mount="/etc/rc.d/diskless"
update_motd="NO"
varsize=8192
</pre>

For FreeBSD 5.1 you have to edit /etc/rc.d/diskless to remove the check for an NFS mount.
<br>Comment out following lines:
<pre>
#dlv=`/sbin/sysctl -n vfs.nfs.diskless_valid 2> /dev/null`
#[ ${dlv:=0} -eq 0 ] && exit 0
</pre>

Don't forget to edit /etc/newsyslog.conf to rotate log files more often and don't archive them. You probably won't want much logging anyway, since all your
log files will be lost when you reboot your machine.

.

.
<h3><li>Tar'ing everything up.</h3>
<br>
Because of the aforementioned inability of cp to reproduce hard links, we'll build a tar archive of our whole wifiBSD installation. Do the following:
<pre>
# cd /usr/wifibsd
# tar cfvz /usr/wifibsd-0.1.tgz *
</pre>
Of course, the name of the .tgz file is a matter of personal taste. 
<br>When it's done, you'll be left with a .tgz file that contains everything (well, almost) for your wifiBSD.

<br>
<h3><li>Generating the flash image.</h3>
<br>
Although we could use the CF card like a hard disk, disklabel and newfs it and explode our tar archive directly on it, I feel it's easier and faster to do
that task in a disk image and dd that directly onto the flash card - besides, it prolongs the life of the CF card by writing every sector only once.
<br>
We'll use vnconfig to get a virtual disk that we can disklabel. You will have to know the size of your flash card in sectors (512 byte units), but you cannot
figure this out without actually connecting the card to your machine (see the beginning of the next section for information on how to do this). Once you got
it connected, use the following command to find out the number of sectors:
<pre>
# bsdlabel -rwn ad[n] auto | grep sectors/unit
</pre>
...of course substituting the proper device number of your flash card for [n].
<br>
Hint: if disklabel reports errors like "No space left on device", try the following command first:
<pre>
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ad[n] bs=1k count=20
</pre>
This will erase any partition information that may already be present on the CF card.
<br>
Now we'll create a disk image of the same size, initially filled with zeroes:
<pre>
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/wifibsd-disk.bin bs=512 count=[number of sectors on your flash card]
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/wifibsd-disk.bin bs=512 count=35000
</pre>
Let's use this disk image file as a vn device so we can disklabel it:
<pre>
# mdconfig -a -t vnode -u 0 -f /usr/wifibsd-disk.bin
</pre>
Our new virtual disk has to be partitioned and the file system created. Use:
<pre>
# bsdlabel -Brw md0 auto
# bsdlabel -e md0
</pre>
You'll be dropped into your editor. Find the line that starts with c: and duplicate it, changing the c: to a: and the fstype to 4.2BSD. This is our root
partition, which will span over the whole slice. If you want a second partition (e.g. for configuration information), reduce the size of the a: slice by the
amount of space you want for your second partition, then make another line starting with e:, an offset equal to the size of a:, and a size equal to what you
subtracted from a:. Save.
Example of how my partitions look like:
<pre>
# /dev/md0:
8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize bps/cpg]
  a:    64256        0    4.2BSD        0     0                                 
  c:    64256        0    unused        0     0         # "raw" part, don't edit
</pre>
Note that we don't have a swap partition - there's nowhere to put it. You can't put swap partitions on your flash card - it's way too slow and would soon ruin
your card. So you better make sure that you've got enough memory for your applications...
<br>
Now let's newfs and mount our partition:
<pre>
# newfs -b 8192 -f 1024 -U /dev/md0a
# mount /dev/md0a /mnt
</pre>
(if you made a second partition earlier on, don't forget to newfs that one, too). So we got our virtual disk mounted on /mnt, and we're now ready to explode
our .tgz onto it:
<pre>
cd /mnt
tar xfvzP /usr/wifibsd.tgz
</pre>
That's it. Let's clean up:
<pre>
# cd /
# umount /mnt
# mdconfig -d -u 0
</pre>
And the following config file:
<pre>
/etc/defaults/pccard.conf
</pre>
And add the following lines to it:
<pre>
# Atheros reference design a/b/g card
card "Atheros Communications, Inc." "AR5001-0000-0000"
        config  auto "ath" ?
        insert  /etc/pccard_ether $device start
        remove  /etc/pccard_ether $device stop
</pre>
Thanks to Rudi van Drunen for that info.

<h3><li>Copying everything to the flash card.</h3>
<br>
This is a bit tricky. You could netboot (with PXE) your net4501 with the CF card installed and copy everything over the network, but preparing a bootable FreeBSD
for this purpose isn't quite simple, either. 
<br>You'll need some kind of adapter in order to connect your CF card to your base system. 
<br>If your base system is a notebook, you can use a CF -> PCMCIA adapter (enable pccardd and you'll see the card as an ATAPI device, like for example ad8) or a
CF -> IDE adapter if it's a desktop machine. 
<br>Either way, you'll end up with an ad[n] device that represents the CF card (it behaves like an IDE hard disk).
<br>
We can now simply transfer the disk image we created in the previous step block-by-block onto our flash card:
<pre>
# dd if=wifibsd-0.1.bin of=/dev/ad[n] bs=8k
</pre>
(make sure you get the value for [n] right in this command or you might erase your hard disk!!!)
<br>
If you want to see the progress, type Ctrl-T.
